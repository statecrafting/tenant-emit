# Setup

Get a fresh clone operational. After this completes, `tenant-emit --help`
works and `/init` can report lifecycle counts through the pinned spec-spine
(no ad-hoc parsing of `.derived/**/*.json`: see
`.claude/rules/governed-artifact-reads.md`).

tenant-emit is emit-only: it produces a factory's run-side governance
certificate, signing with an operator key, and is never a verifier (no
signature re-check, no artifact re-derivation, no corpus-binding
adjudication). Governance is dogfooded through the **pinned spec-spine
binary** (`.bin/spec-spine ...`), installed by `make tools`.

## Process

### 1. Build the binary

```bash
cargo build --release -p tenant-emit-cli
```

Halt on non-zero exit and surface the failing step verbatim. The build
needs a Rust toolchain (the pinned version lives in `rust-toolchain.toml`).

### 2. Run the workspace tests and lints

```bash
cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

Halt on the first failure. Clippy must be clean (warnings are denied).

### 3. Smoke the CLI

```bash
target/release/tenant-emit --help
```

Confirm the binary runs and lists its verb (`build-certificate`). The
emit core is implemented; `--help` and `--version` exit 0. A verb run
exits 0 (certificate emitted), or 2 (usage / I/O error, including a
`--require-operator-key` refusal when signing material resolves to an
ephemeral key).

### 4. Verify the dogfood governance loop

The `specs/` corpus is governed by the pinned spec-spine. spec-spine
**commits** its compiled artifacts under `.derived/` (only
`build-meta.json` is gitignored), so the committed registry is the
reference for lifecycle queries. Smoke-test the gates `/init` and CI
depend on:

```bash
make tools                     # install the exact spec-spine.toml pin
.bin/spec-spine compile         # regenerate the registry deterministically
.bin/spec-spine index check     # codebase index staleness gate
.bin/spec-spine lint --fail-on-warn   # corpus conformance
```

`index check` exits 0 when fresh, 1 for a finding (including stale), 2
when refused, 3 for usage, and 4 when failed. Regenerate and re-commit only
for a confirmed stale-index finding. Diagnose every other nonzero result
before continuing. Do not parse `.derived/**/*.json` to verify success.

### 5. Emit summary

Report exactly:

```
## setup: tenant-emit

**Build:** {ok / failed at <step>}
**Tests:** {pass / failed}
**Clippy:** {clean / N warnings}
**CLI smoke:** {help shown / failed}
**Governed loop:**
  - compile: {fresh registry / failed}
  - index check: {fresh / stale}
  - lint: {clean / N diagnostics}
**Lifecycle:** {N specs across <statuses>}  (from registry status-report)

Next: run `/init` to load full session context.
```

Do not invent counts. Only report values that came back from a command.

## Rules

- The build target is `cargo build --release -p tenant-emit-cli`. The
  governance loop runs through `.bin/spec-spine`, the pinned
  repository-local binary.
- Halt on first failure. Do not silently continue past a missing
  prerequisite or a failing gate.
- Never parse `.derived/**/*.json` directly in any verification step.
  Use the `spec-spine` subcommands.
- Emit-only: never add a verifier path (signature re-check, artifact
  re-derivation, corpus-binding adjudication) or any network surface as
  part of setup. The corpus binding is read, never recomputed.
- Idempotent: safe to re-run. Cargo skips up-to-date crates; `compile`
  is deterministic.
