summary: >
  How the tenant-emit emitter reaches a produced application: the CLI verb
  surface (`build-certificate`, with `--tenant-mode`, the signer flags,
  `--require-operator-key`, the `--corpus-attestation` and `--sbom-dir`
  read-paths, the automatic agentic-posture read off the frozen Build Spec
  (spec 210 FR-002, no flag), and the `--require-corpus-binding` /
  `--require-sbom-binding` guards that exit 2 rather than emit a certificate that
  lost a binding it was told to carry, all under a fixed exit-code contract), the
  prebuilt-binary npm shim a TS/JS app pins next to spec-spine and tenant-tail
  (one exact-version devDependency), and the tag-gated release pipeline that
  builds the five per-triple archives (with CycloneDX SBOM + .sha256 sidecars +
  SLSA provenance) and assembles the `@tenant-emit/cli-<os>-<cpu>` platform
  packages. The shim is a launcher, not a native addon, and mirrors spec-spine's
  npm/ shape. A parallel PyPI channel (`uvx tenant-emit ...`) ships the same
  prebuilt binary as five per-platform wheels plus an sdist refusal fallback,
  from the same release archives (no second Rust build). The read-never-recompute
  guard (clippy.toml + deny.toml) keeps the corpus read-path honest.

# 002: Distribution

## 1. Purpose

`cargo install tenant-emit-cli` puts the binary on a machine, but a produced
TypeScript/JS application's reflex is `npm i -D tenant-emit`, pinned next to
`spec-spine` and `tenant-tail`, and it will not install a Rust toolchain to
produce its own paperwork. This spec governs the verb surface that application
invokes and the machinery that delivers it: the npm and PyPI binary shims and
the release pipeline.

## 2. Territory

- `crates/tenant-emit-cli/src/main.rs`: the verb surface. `build-certificate` is
  the single verb (a subcommand of the `tenant-emit` binary). It carries the
  positional `<run-dir>`, the signer flags (`--tenant-mode`, `--signer-subject`,
  `--signer-identity-provider`, `--signer-session-id`), `--stage-ids`,
  `--require-operator-key` (spec 220 FR-003), `--corpus-attestation` (spec 220
  FR-007, read via the public `spec_spine_core::attest::attestation_hash` seam)
  with `--require-corpus-binding` (refuse to emit, exit 2, unless the corpus
  binding is actually applied), `--sbom-dir` (spec 203 FR-003: reads
  `<root>/.factory/{sbom.cdx.json,audit.json}`, hashes the bytes, and lifts the
  BOM tool version from the BOM's `metadata.tools`; read, never recompute) with
  `--require-sbom-binding` (the symmetric refuse-if-unapplied guard for the SBOM
  binding), `--out`, and `--adapter`. It also reads the produced app's declared
  agentic posture off the frozen Build Spec at
  `<run-dir>/s5-ui-specification/build-spec.yaml` (spec 210 FR-002,
  `resolve_posture_binding`; no flag, like the build-spec-hash lift) and binds it
  via the engine's `agentic_posture_binding`. No verify verb is reachable.
- `clippy.toml`, `deny.toml`: the read-never-recompute guard. clippy bans the
  attestation-emit / corpus-recompute symbols (`attest`, `verify_recompute`,
  `attest_json`, `verify_attestation_json`); cargo-deny bans depending on the
  `spec-spine-cli` crate. The emit CLI calls only the reader seam.
- `npm/`: the prebuilt-binary distribution shim (launcher + platform resolver +
  publish-time platform-package generator + its unit test and smoke test). A
  faithful mirror of spec-spine's `npm/`.
- `py/`: the parallel PyPI channel (wheels + sdist refusal), mirroring spec-spine.
- `.github/workflows/`: CI (build/test/clippy/fmt + spec-spine self-governance +
  determinism), the determinism golden, the tag-gated release pipeline, and the
  AI PR review (`ai-pr-review.yml`), a reusable workflow ci.yml dispatches into
  `ci-gate` so a failed or absent review blocks merge (green ci-gate => actually
  reviewed or visibly skipped).

## 3. Behavior

- `npx --no-install tenant-emit build-certificate <run-dir> ...` MUST run the
  emitter offline, forwarding argv unchanged to the prebuilt binary (the launcher
  is a pure translation layer; it adds no flags).
- The verb MUST honor a fixed exit-code contract, with every configuration or
  input error checked before anything is written so a rejected emission leaves no
  partial certificate on disk: `0` on success; `1` only for a runtime I/O failure
  after the certificate was built (it could not be persisted); and `2` for every
  up-front configuration or input error (the run directory is missing, the signer
  flags are partial or `--tenant-mode` carries no signer, an operator-supplied
  key is malformed, `--require-operator-key` resolved to an ephemeral key, a
  required binding could not be applied, or a `--business-docs` file is
  unreadable). A malformed operator key is a config error (exit 2), never a
  silent ephemeral downgrade.
- `--require-corpus-binding` and `--require-sbom-binding` MUST refuse to emit
  (exit 2) unless the named binding is actually applied. Because a binding is
  applied only on the signer (tenant) build path (spec 001 §3), requiring one
  requires both that its artifact resolved (a corpus attestation, or the BOM +
  audit pair) AND that a signer is present, so a production emission can never
  silently ship a certificate that dropped a binding it was told to carry behind
  a warning. The two guards mirror `--require-operator-key`.
- The agentic-posture read-path (spec 210 FR-002) MUST be automatic (no flag)
  and read, never recompute: when a frozen Build Spec is present at
  `<run-dir>/s5-ui-specification/build-spec.yaml`, the verb parses its
  `agentic_posture` block and binds it; a Build Spec that omits the block binds
  `none`/`defaulted: true` (visibly defaulted); an absent or unparseable Build
  Spec leaves the posture unstated (no binding, never silently `none`). Like the
  other bindings it is applied only on the signer path. It has no `--require-*`
  guard: the posture is a property of the produced app, not an operator input the
  emission must be forced to carry.
- The five platform targets (darwin-arm64, darwin-x64, linux-x64, linux-arm64,
  win32-x64) are a single fact kept in lockstep across the npm platform map, the
  py platform map, the generators, and the release matrix.
- The release pipeline MUST be tag-gated, build one archive per triple with a
  `.sha256` sidecar, a CycloneDX SBOM, and a SLSA build-provenance attestation,
  and publish idempotently to crates.io + npm + PyPI. The PyPI channel reuses the
  same release archives (no second Rust build).
- The Linux release binaries MUST honor the `manylinux_2_17` glibc floor that the
  PyPI wheel tags promise: they are cross-linked against glibc 2.17 (via `cargo
  zigbuild --target <triple>.2.17`) and `release.yml` asserts, from the ELF
  dynamic symbol table, that no referenced `GLIBC_x.y` symbol exceeds 2.17 before
  publishing. A toolchain bump that raised the floor fails the release rather
  than shipping a `manylinux_2_17` wheel tag that is a lie.
- CI MUST run clippy with `-D warnings` so the read-never-recompute clippy.toml
  ban is enforced as a hard error, and MUST run the spec-spine dogfood gate
  (compile / index check / lint / couple) over this repo's own corpus.
- The AI PR review MUST classify a Claude CLI failure rather than fail blindly:
  an unset `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` or an auth/permission error hard-fails (a
  broken token must be fixed, not masked, preserving the anti-silent-green
  guard), while any other API failure (overloaded, rate-limit, 5xx, timeout,
  network) passes `ci-gate` with a loud, visible PR notice so a third-party
  Anthropic incident does not block merges. The pass is never silent.
- The cross-tool round-trip is the acceptance contract: a certificate emitted by
  `build-certificate` verifies clean under `tenant-tail verify-certificate`
  (including `--corpus-attestation`), and tampering any artifact or the
  attestation fails verification (exit 1).

## 4. Out of scope

- The emit engine itself (owned by `001-certificate-emit-core`).
- The firing step that invokes the emitter at run completion (spec 220 FR-002)
  and the kernel pin: OAP-side Leg C. Once tenant-emit cuts a release, OAP pins it.
- The npm/PyPI publish credentials and the actual publish event: an operator /
  release-trigger concern, not source.

## Managed governance enrollment (2026-10-02)

The owner requested enrollment on spec-spine =0.28.0 and the Statecraft
github-actions-rust profile revision 13. The adopted pin remains the single
version authority. The managed profile installs .bin/spec-spine, preserves
signed commits, checks every commit, enforces source coverage and ratified
path ownership, and requires owner review for authority changes.
The legacy aggregate is ci-legacy; require both ci-gate and ci-legacy until
the distribution-specific checks move into the managed profile.

## Managed governance refresh (2026-10-02)

The owner approved Statecraft profile revision 14 and fleet convergence after
the revision-13 enrollment. This amendment adopts revision 14 with the
existing exact spec-spine =0.28.0 pin and preserves the actual Rust code
checks, all current governance parameters, and protected owner review.
The revision-13 enrollment above remains the historical adoption record.
The managed installer remains at .bin/spec-spine.
Both ci-gate and ci-legacy remain required until the legacy workflow retires.
The four-platform determinism workflow retains its Windows-compatible
scratch installation of the exact same pinned engine. Revision 14 does not
deliver the Windows executable-suffix repair needed to replace that path.
