# CLAUDE.md: tenant-emit

Project overview, invariants, and conventions. Read by `/init` at the start of
every session (see AGENTS.md for the init protocol).

## What this is

tenant-emit is the vended, emit-only tenant CLI: it produces a signed
`governance-certificate.json` from a finished `.factory/runs/<run-id>/` directory.
It is the emit-side counterpart of tenant-tail (which verifies the same artifact).
Both are extracted from OAP's `factory-engine` and relicensed Apache-2.0 (see
NOTICE); both are pinned by the born-with kernel next to `spec-spine`.

The product binary is `tenant-emit`; its single verb is `build-certificate`.
Governance runs through the exact-pinned repository-local `spec-spine` CLI
(`.bin/spec-spine ...`), installed by `make tools`.

## Load-bearing invariants

- **Emit-only by construction.** No verify verb, no verifier dependency. The
  verify/emit boundary is the whole point (spec 220 AC-6, spec 219
  verify-only-by-construction): tenant-emit never verifies, tenant-tail never
  emits, and the two stay separate distributables. Never add a `verify-*` verb.
- **The cross-tool round-trip is the definition of correct.** A certificate
  emitted by `tenant-emit build-certificate` MUST verify clean under
  `tenant-tail verify-certificate` (including `--corpus-attestation`), and
  tampering any artifact or the attestation MUST fail verification (exit 1).
- **Certificate version is pinned to "1.5.0".** tenant-tail's verifier checks the
  version by strict equality, and carries the additive `corpusBinding` field at
  1.5.0. The emitter pins the same string so the round-trip exits 0. Do NOT bump
  to OAP's 1.6.0: that would fail the verifier's version gate. `corpusBinding` is
  additive (skipped when absent), not a version bump for this emit/verify pair.
- **Read, never recompute (corpus + SBOM bindings).** `--corpus-attestation`
  hashes the supplied attestation via the public reader seam
  `spec_spine_core::attest::attestation_hash` only. The attestation-emit /
  corpus-recompute surface (`attest`, `verify_recompute`, `attest_json`,
  `verify_attestation_json`) is banned at the symbol level (`clippy.toml`
  disallowed-methods, enforced by `-D warnings`) and the crate level (cargo-deny
  bans depending on `spec-spine-cli`). The CLI test
  `banned_attestation_emit_paths_still_resolve` keeps `clippy.toml` honest. The
  `--sbom-dir` binding (spec 203 FR-003) follows the same posture: the produced
  app's `.factory/sbom.cdx.json` + `.factory/audit.json` are byte-hashed as-is
  (BOM tool version read from the BOM's own `metadata.tools`), never
  regenerated. Both bindings are additive (skipped when absent) and applied only
  on the signer path; `--require-corpus-binding` / `--require-sbom-binding` exit
  2 rather than silently emitting a cert that lost the binding it was told to
  carry.
- **Anonymous signing forbidden, ephemeral refused in production.**
  `--tenant-mode` with no signer halts before emitting (exit 2);
  `--require-operator-key` exits 2 if signing resolves to an ephemeral key. A
  malformed operator-supplied key is a config error (exit 2), never a silent
  ephemeral fall-back. The Ed25519 key is operator-supplied (`OAP_SIGNING_KEY` /
  `OAP_SIGNING_KEY_PATH`), outside any agent's write scope, and its filesystem
  path is never written into the certificate (the signing attestation records
  only the source kind). The emitter signs the certificate, not the corpus
  attestation.
- **Determinism.** Re-emitting from the same run directory yields identical
  artifact and certificate content modulo the signer + timestamp (spec 220 AC-7).
- **`unsafe_code` is forbidden workspace-wide.**

## Layout

```
crates/
  tenant-emit-types/   the emit-surface DTOs (certificate, signer, manifest, state)
  tenant-emit-core/    the emit engine (builder, signing, run-dir scan, hashing)
  tenant-emit-cli/     the `tenant-emit` binary (the build-certificate verb)
npm/ , py/             prebuilt-binary distribution shims (mirror spec-spine's)
specs/                 this repo's spec corpus (governed by spec-spine)
clippy.toml, deny.toml the read-never-recompute guard
```

The cert DTOs (types crate) are preserved byte-for-byte from OAP so the canonical
JSON, the self-hash, and the Ed25519 signature stay identical to what tenant-tail
re-derives. The engine (core crate) builds and signs them; the CLI (cli crate)
exposes the verb and the corpus read-path.

## Working in this repo

- Build the product binary: `cargo build --release -p tenant-emit-cli`.
- Gate before commit: `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo clippy --workspace
  --all-targets -- -D warnings`, `cargo fmt --all --check`, and the spec-spine
  dogfood (`.bin/spec-spine compile && .bin/spec-spine index check &&
  .bin/spec-spine lint --fail-on-warn`).
- Read compiled artifacts (`.derived/**`) through `spec-spine` subcommands, never
  via ad-hoc `jq`/`python`/`sed` (see `.claude/rules/governed-artifact-reads.md`).
- OAP stays the source of truth for the emit core; this repo carries an extracted
  copy in behavior parity. Changes that affect certificate content must preserve
  the round-trip with tenant-tail.

## Out of scope (OAP-side Leg C, not this repo)

- The firing step that invokes the emitter at run completion (spec 220 FR-002).
- The kernel pin that installs tenant-emit next to tenant-tail and spec-spine.
- The platform countersign / tenant-to-OAP uplink (a tenant cert is unsealed by
  design).

## House style

No em dash (U+2014) anywhere: chat, code, comments, docs, commits. Use a colon,
comma, parentheses, or two sentences. A PreToolUse hook blocks file writes that
introduce U+2014.
